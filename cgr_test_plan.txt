test plan:
 
1)Firstly testing is done for all the provided files in the question. The files are saved in a text 		file, then run through the program, Saves the output in filename_out.pbm. Finally the output is 	compared to the actual output obtained from the ques. The difference is computed using diff.

2) this is a very basic test with input "ACGT" for proving the dots agr getting to their assigned 		corner. This test case also covers that part where we test for upper cases inputs.

3) Testing for invalid Scale values. Thus when scale is too small, scale is too big ans scale is not a 		power of 2
